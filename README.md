# crdt-richtext

> Rust implementation of [Peritext](https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/) and
> [Fugue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583)

This crate contains a subset of [Loro CRDT](https://loro.dev/)(which is not yet
open-source)

[**ðŸ“š See the blog post**](https://loro-dev.notion.site/crdt-richtext-Rust-implementation-of-Peritext-and-Fugue-c49ef2a411c0404196170ac8daf066c0)

_The interface is not yet stable and is subject to changes. Do not use it in
production._

This lib combines Peritext and Fugue's power with impressive performance,
tailored specifically for rich text.

## Benchmark

The benchmark was conducted on a 2020 M1 MacBook Pro 13-inch on 2023-05-11.

The complete benchmark result and code is available
[here](https://github.com/zxch3n/fugue-bench/blob/main/results_table.md).

- The benchmark for Automerge is based on `automerge-wasm`, which is not the
  latest version of Automerge 2.0.
- `crdt-richtext` and `fugue` are special-purpose CRDTs that tend to be faster
  and have a smaller encoding size.
- The encoding of `yjs`, `ywasm`, and `loro-wasm` still contains redundancy that
  can be compressed significantly. For more details, see
  [the full report](https://loro.dev/docs/performance/docsize).
- loro-wasm and fugue only support plain text for now
